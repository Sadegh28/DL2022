# Deep Learning- Fall 2022

**Instructor**: [Sadegh Eskandari](https://sadegh28.github.io/eskandari) 

**Lectures**: Sunday 12:00-14:00 and Tuesday 14:00-16:00

**Textbooks**: [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, and A. Courville, and [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch) by E. Stevens, L. Antiga, and T. Viehmann

**Description**: This course aims to teach the fundamentals of deep learning. We will take an in-depth look at artifical neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and deep generative models. We will also provide hands-on lectures using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
